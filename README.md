# Next.js Routing Concept Project

This project demonstrates various routing concepts in Next.js, showcasing dynamic and nested routing capabilities. It was built using Next.js and developed with the assistance of Cursor AI through effective prompting.

## Project Overview

This application is a simple product catalog that demonstrates the following Next.js routing concepts:

1. Basic static routing
2. Dynamic routing with `[productId]`
3. Nested dynamic routing with `[productId]` and `[reviewId]`
4. Shared layout component
5. Navigation between pages

## Key Features

- Home page with a list of products
- Individual product pages with reviews
- Nested review pages for each product
- About and Contact pages
- Consistent layout across all pages

## Routing Structure

- `/` - Home page (list of products)
- `/about` - About page
- `/contact` - Contact page
- `/products/[productId]` - Individual product page
- `/products/[productId]/reviews/[reviewId]` - Individual review page

## Development Process

This project was developed using Next.js and built with the assistance of Cursor AI. The development process involved:

1. Defining the routing structure and requirements
2. Implementing basic pages and components
3. Adding dynamic routing for products and reviews
4. Creating a shared layout component
5. Styling the application for a better user experience

By leveraging effective prompting techniques with Cursor AI, the development process was streamlined, allowing for rapid implementation of Next.js routing concepts.
